<p>Shane Farrell is a passionate games programmer currently studying in his third year of a BSc in Computer Science. He has been programming consistently since the age of ten and has a natural programmer mindset - finding it easy to grasp, visualise and explain problems. He is a naturally good presenter and can present more complex topics in a simple and easily understandable manner. He has presented to Microsoft, customers and technical staff. Shane is familiar with a wide range of languages including Python, C, C++, C#, Java, PHP, HTML/CSS, Javascript and SQL and can work confidently within any object oriented system.</p>

<p>Shane operates extremely well within a team, working under little supervision and being forthcoming with suggestions. He is capable in teams of various sizes and has a good knowledge of both Git and SOLID design principles. During his first year of employment at Greenfinch Technology he reported directly to the technical lead on two projects, he fixed bugs on the company's main project and worked on converting a Javascript image processing project to C++. He proposed a new algorithm for this project that improved execution speeds by a factor of thousands. During his second year he researched and designed a prototype program for Google Glass; demonstrating this to the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland, writing up company documentation and creating a blog post on the subject.</p>

<p>Shane was also one of the lead designers and programmers on a large online collaborative Mario-esque fangame involving over 100 levels. The levels he submitted are often considered the most fun and are easily the most technically advanced levels in the game. He helped organise a team of over 60 people and was one of the main contributors during the beta testing process. The game was extremely well received and has many people doing playthroughs of it on YouTube.</p>
